## Modules

This section contains rules for modules.

### Entity Order

The order of entities used in a module should follow the order below:

1. `const`
2. `fun`

_Entities in a module can be ordered using the "Order Entities" LSP Code Action._

### Comments

The module should have a comment before it describing what it is for and giving
some examples of it's usage.

All functions should have a comment before them describing what the function
does and a code block showing an example or test case.
